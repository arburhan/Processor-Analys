review

#pros
"Reasonably priced with great value. Great, lightweight technology and good support from partner."
"It is also more affordable than most similar tools. The company behind the technology has been a pleasure to work with and is very responsive to our questions."
"I love that our website visitors can now generate a nice, shareable pdf file off of content from the site."
"Overall we are really happy. Anytime we have questions, the support via chat helps us out within minutes.

#cons
"The only thing I have found difficult is the alignment of components in the template builder."
